## Introduction
An assignment from school in which I had to make a desktop application with C#
Pictured below is an image from the last page of the application. Showing CRUD functions and the data displayed in a table. 
![Image of the application showing user selections and the other saved user profiles](https://github.com/BranRead/custom-character/assets/117762022/03ca41d2-2c93-4228-b7ea-0943c87bd7a7)
The user is able to select facial features on the first page and then on the second their selections are shown as well. Along with Entries for their name, address, occupation and hobby. 
The user can then save their face they've created, as well as the other details they've entered. The table on the right shows the data from all the saved user info. Clicking one of these will display their info in the text boxes, dropdowns and the face preview.
The info can be edited and then updated in the database by clicking [Update]. The user can also be deleted byt instead clicking [Delete].
